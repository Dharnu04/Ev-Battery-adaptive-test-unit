## üí° Overview

This project proposes a multicell adaptive testing approach for Lithium-ion batteries in Electric Vehicles (EVs) to overcome the limitations of traditional single-cell testing, which is time-consuming and lacks scalability. Our system concurrently estimates the State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH) of multiple battery cells in parallel, significantly reducing testing time and improving efficiency. It integrates a dual filter concept to select high-quality cells for battery packs and employs a custom Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) model for accurate SOC/SOH estimation and predictive temperature forecasting. This system aims to enhance battery testing productivity and ensure higher accuracy in estimations, contributing to more reliable and efficient EV batteries.
